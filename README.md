# Transaction_Categorization
Transaction Categorization phase deals with cleansing and categorization of transactional data of Banks namely into 4 categories: whether the transactional data contains information about the transaction-channel, the action that was carried out, the merchant mentioned in transactional data (if any) and the location detail mentioned (if any).
sub-phases of transaction categorization:
  > data cleansing
  
  > frequent pattern mining
  
  > creation of grammar based on frequent patterns
  
  > tagging grammar to the cleansed data
  
  > back mapping grammar-tags (or tokens) to the raw transactional data.
